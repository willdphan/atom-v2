# Atom, a Personalized Chat Assistant

ATOM is a personal assistant for managing and reviewing my schedule.

It uses various APIs and packages such as OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Google Calendar, and Twilio to offer several features such as creating/deleting calendar events and searching the internet for answers to specific questions. 

The code uses a microphone to receive audio inputs from users, transcribes them into text, and then generates audio responses for the user.
